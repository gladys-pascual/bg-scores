### Accessibility
Ensure accessibility throughout the website by:
  - Adding 'alt' text on all images.
  - Font awesome icons are in an `<i>` tag. A span with a class "sr-only" is added which describes the icons. The "sr-only" class has a display:none in the stylesheet, which hides the text on screen, but allows for screenreader to be read.
